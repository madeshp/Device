3. Define Fraud Detection Rules
Establish rules to detect suspicious cross-country transactions:

Unusual Device Locations:
Identify if the device location for a deposit differs significantly from the withdrawal location.
Flag scenarios where the deposit occurs in one country, and withdrawal occurs from a different device location outside the USA.
Rapid Sequence of Transactions:
Look for deposits followed by withdrawals within short time intervals.
Validate if devices used in these transactions belong to different regions or countries.
Transaction Patterns:
Monitor accounts with repeated cross-border transactions.
Correlate with device profiles for consistency (e.g., checking if the same device has been flagged previously).


 Device Location Mismatch
Rule: Flag transactions where:

Deposit Location: The device's geolocation at the time of deposit is significantly different from the usual or historical locations for that account.
Withdrawal Location: The device's geolocation at the time of withdrawal indicates a different country, especially one associated with high-risk activity or where the account holder has no history of activity.
Logic:

Use Iovation’s geolocation data (latitude, longitude, country).
Compare geolocations of devices used for deposit and withdrawal.
Look for patterns such as a deposit in the U.S. and withdrawal in a high-risk country like Russia, China, or Nigeria.
Example:

Deposit made from a device in New York, U.S., and a withdrawal occurs from a device in Lagos, Nigeria, within a short timeframe (e.g., 30 minutes).
2. Unfamiliar Device Usage
Rule: Flag transactions where:

The device making a withdrawal has never been associated with the account before.
The device score or trustworthiness (provided by Iovation) is below a predefined threshold.
Logic:

Use Iovation’s device fingerprinting to identify unique device IDs.
Check the account's transaction history to see if the device has been used before.
Assess the device's reputation score from Iovation (indicating its history of fraudulent behavior or anomalies).
Example:

Deposit made from a known, trusted device, but the withdrawal is made using a device flagged as risky or previously associated with fraudulent activity.
3. Rapid Device Switching Across Countries
Rule: Flag transactions where:

The same account shows activity from devices located in different countries within an unusually short period.
Logic:

Use timestamps and geolocation data.
Identify cases where the time difference between deposit and withdrawal is too short to account for physical travel between the two locations.
Example:

Deposit at 10:00 AM from a device in Chicago, U.S., followed by a withdrawal at 10:05 AM from a device in London, U.K.
4. Multiple Accounts, Single Device
Rule: Detect devices being used to transact across multiple accounts, especially when those accounts show cross-country deposit/withdrawal patterns.

Logic:

Use Iovation to track a unique device ID's activity across accounts.
Flag if a single device is used to deposit into multiple U.S. accounts and then withdraw from multiple international locations.
Example:

Device ID XYZ123 is used for deposits into accounts A, B, and C in the U.S. and withdrawals from locations in different countries.
5. Device and Network Anomalies
Rule: Flag transactions involving:

Devices that show suspicious characteristics such as:
Use of VPNs or proxies to mask true location.
Frequent changes in network configurations (e.g., IP address or ISP).
Devices flagged as high-risk or blacklisted by Iovation.
Logic:

Utilize Iovation’s IP and network fingerprinting features.
Cross-check device metadata against known VPN/proxy IP ranges.
Leverage Iovation’s fraud network data to identify devices linked to past fraudulent activity.
Example:

Deposit from a U.S.-based IP, but the IP is identified as a VPN server. Withdrawal occurs using a different VPN server in another country.
6. Account-Device Behavioral Changes
Rule: Identify accounts exhibiting unusual device behavior compared to historical patterns:

Account consistently used from a single country suddenly shows activity from multiple international locations.
Device associated with low-risk activities starts performing high-risk transactions.
Logic:

Build a baseline for each account using Iovation’s device insights.
Monitor for deviations, such as:
Device used in high-risk countries.
Device time zone mismatch.
Example:

An account historically accessed from personal devices in California suddenly makes a deposit via a mobile device in the U.S. and a withdrawal from a public computer in Europe.
