3. Define Fraud Detection Rules
Establish rules to detect suspicious cross-country transactions:

Unusual Device Locations:
Identify if the device location for a deposit differs significantly from the withdrawal location.
Flag scenarios where the deposit occurs in one country, and withdrawal occurs from a different device location outside the USA.
Rapid Sequence of Transactions:
Look for deposits followed by withdrawals within short time intervals.
Validate if devices used in these transactions belong to different regions or countries.
Transaction Patterns:
Monitor accounts with repeated cross-border transactions.
Correlate with device profiles for consistency (e.g., checking if the same device has been flagged previously).
